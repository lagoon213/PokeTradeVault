# Architecture

## System Architecture

PokeTradeVault follows a modern web application architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## High-Level Components

### Frontend
- **Technology**: React/Vue.js (to be decided in [[Technology Stack]])
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User interface rendering
  - Client-side validation
  - State management
  - API communication

### Backend API
- **Technology**: Node.js/Python/Go (to be decided in [[Technology Stack]])
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Business logic processing
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Data validation
  - Database operations
  - External API integration

### Database
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB (to be decided in [[Technology Stack]])
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Data persistence
  - Transaction management
  - Data integrity

### Cache Layer
- **Technology**: Redis
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Session storage
  - Frequently accessed data caching
  - Performance optimization

## Communication Flow

```
User -> Frontend -> API Gateway -> Backend Services -> Database
                              â†“
                            Cache
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **Modularity** - Components are loosely coupled and independently deployable
2. **Scalability** - Architecture supports horizontal scaling
3. **Security** - Security is built into every layer
4. **Maintainability** - Code is organized and well-documented
