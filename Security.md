## Security Considerations

Comprehensive security measures for PokeTradeVault.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Password Security
- **Hashing**: bcrypt with work factor of 12
- **Minimum Requirements**:
  - 8 characters minimum
  - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers
  - Special characters recommended
- **Storage**: Never store plaintext passwords
- **Transmission**: HTTPS only

### Token-Based Authentication
- **JWT Tokens** with reasonable expiration (24 hours)
- **Refresh Tokens** for extended sessions (future)
- **Token Storage**:
  - HTTP-only cookies for web
  - Secure storage for mobile apps
- **Token Rotation** on suspicious activity

### Session Management
- Track active sessions per user
- Ability to revoke all sessions (logout everywhere)
- Automatic logout on token expiration
- Activity-based session extension

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- **Authentication Endpoints**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **General API**: 100 requests per minute per user
- **Search**: 30 requests per minute
- **Punishment**: Exponential backoff for violators

### Input Validation
- Validate all inputs on server side
- Sanitize user-generated content
- Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Limit request payload size
- Content-Type validation

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- Whitelist allowed origins
- Credentials included only for trusted domains
- Proper preflight handling

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all connections
- **At Rest**: Database encryption (future)
- **Sensitive Fields**: Additional encryption for emails

### Data Privacy
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only see their data
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary information
- **Right to Deletion**: Support account deletion
- **Data Export**: Allow users to export their data

### Personal Information
- Email addresses kept private
- Optional public profile fields
- Trade history visible only to participants
- IP addresses logged but not exposed

## Application Security

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Use ORM/query builder (Sequelize, Prisma)
- Parameterized queries only
- Avoid dynamic SQL construction
- Regular security audits

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Prevention
- Escape all user-generated content
- Content Security Policy headers
- Use secure React patterns (avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- Sanitize markdown/rich text

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Prevention
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- SameSite cookie attribute
- Verify origin header

## Trade Security

### Trade Integrity
- Atomic database transactions for trades
- Validate Pokemon ownership before trade
- Lock Pokemon during active trades
- Audit log for all trade actions

### Fraud Prevention
- Reputation system to identify bad actors
- Trade limits for new accounts
- Cooldown periods after suspicious activity
- Report system for fraudulent trades

## Infrastructure Security

### Server Security
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular security patches
- Firewall configuration
- Intrusion detection (future)

### Environment Variables
- Store secrets in environment variables
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use secret management service (future)
- Rotate secrets regularly

### Database Security
- Separate database user for application
- Minimal required permissions
- Encrypted connections
- Regular backups
- Backup encryption

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- Log authentication attempts
- Monitor for unusual patterns
- Alert on multiple failed logins
- Track API abuse

### Incident Response Plan
1. Detect and confirm incident
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Investigate and determine scope
4. Remediate vulnerabilities
5. Notify affected users if needed
6. Post-incident review

## Compliance

### GDPR Considerations (if applicable)
- Right to access data
- Right to deletion
- Right to data portability
- Privacy policy clearly displayed
- Cookie consent

### Security Best Practices
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing (future)
- Security training for developers
