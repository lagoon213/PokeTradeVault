# Trade System

## Trade Workflow

The trade system enables users to propose, negotiate, and complete Pokemon trades.

## Trade States

1. **Proposed** - Initial state when trade is created
2. **Accepted** - Recipient accepts the trade proposal
3. **Rejected** - Recipient declines the trade proposal
4. **Completed** - Trade is successfully completed
5. **Cancelled** - Proposer cancels before completion

## Trade Process

### 1. Creating a Trade Proposal

1. User A selects Pokemon from their vault to offer
2. User A selects desired Pokemon from User B's vault
3. System creates trade proposal in "Proposed" state
4. User B receives notification

### 2. Reviewing a Trade

1. User B views trade details
2. User B can:
   - Accept the trade
   - Reject the trade
   - Counter-propose (future feature)

### 3. Completing a Trade

1. When trade is accepted:
   - System validates Pokemon still exist and are available
   - System transfers Pokemon ownership
   - System updates trade status to "Completed"
   - Both users receive confirmation

### 4. Cancelling a Trade

- Proposer can cancel anytime before acceptance
- System updates trade status to "Cancelled"
- Recipient receives notification

## Business Rules

### Validation Rules
- Cannot trade Pokemon not owned by proposer
- Cannot request Pokemon not owned by recipient
- Cannot trade Pokemon already in active trades
- Both parties must have active accounts

### Fair Trading
- No duplicate Pokemon in same trade offer
- Pokemon must be marked as "for trade"
- System logs all trade activity for audit

### Trade Limits
- Maximum Pokemon per trade: 6 (negotiable)
- Can have up to 5 active trade proposals at once
- 24-hour cooldown after cancelling 3 trades in a row

## Security Considerations

- Prevent trade manipulation
- Validate all Pokemon data before transfer
- Implement trade locking mechanism
- Audit trail for all trades

## Future Enhancements

- Counter-proposal system
- Multi-party trades
- Trade templates
- Automated matching system
- Trade analytics and insights
